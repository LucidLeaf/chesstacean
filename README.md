An incomplete implementation of a little-known game called "chess" in Rust.
This is my first project in Rust.

TODO

    - implement promotion
    - implement half-move-clock
    - implement draw (stalemate, half-move-clock)
    - generate move tree for n
    - check amount of legal moves for correctness

Future ideas

    - remove Position in favor of pure indices
