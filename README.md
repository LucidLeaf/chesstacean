An incomplete implementation of a little-known game called "chess" in Rust.
This is my first project in Rust.

TODO

    - Refactor sliding moves
    - rename for consistency
    - maybe change from relative move instructions to absolute

    - implement castling
    - implement promotion
    - finding all legal moves
    - generate move tree for n
